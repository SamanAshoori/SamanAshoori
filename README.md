## 📚 Currently Learning and Exploring

### Programming / Data Science
* **C++:** Working on "becoming cracked" at C++ to deepen my fundamentals of computing and work on software.
* **Boot.Dev:** Currently enrolled in the GoLang path on Boot.Dev to work on my backend programming skills as well as computing fundamentals (Git, Linux, Docker).
* **Python:** Focusing on core programming principles, data structures, and standard data analysis libraries (e.g., NumPy, Pandas).
* **Applied Data Science:** Deepening my understanding of statistical analysis, data cleaning, and visualization techniques. Using tools such as WEKA and Python libraries for machine learning and computer vision.

### Games Development
* **Godot Engine:** Actively learning the Godot engine and its scripting language (GDScript) to understand game loop architecture, 2D/3D development, and physics.
